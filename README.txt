<h2> Philosphy of life</h2>

<p>
Philosophy has been a topic I’ve been interested in since I was a kid. The various types of ideologies an individual can have pique my curiosity to its max. 
From god complexes to smaller topics such as Machiavellism. Miyamoto Musashi is one of the biggest philosophical figures in history, well-known for his way of being a stoic. 
After diving into his ideas and motives, I’ve incorporated some of those ideas into my own life. You can learn more about him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi" target=_blank>here.</a>

<h2> Basketball</h2>
<p>
Basketball is my favorite sport. I've been playing this beautiful sport ever since 8th grade. After I've gotten my growth spurt, I wasn't going to let my
height go to waste. Till this day, I'm trying to get better at it.
